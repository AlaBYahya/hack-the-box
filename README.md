## What is HackTheBox?

"Hack The Box is an online platform allowing you to test your penetration testing skills and exchange ideas and methodologies with thousands of people in the security field." - [hackthebox.com](https://hackthebox.com)

"**Machines/Boxes** are instances of vulnerable virtual machines. These are virtualized services, virtualized operating systems, and virtualized hardware. Boxes can host different Operating Systems; Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, and more."

"**Challenges** are bite-sized applications for different pentesting techniques." They are similar to traditional CTF-style tasks.

More info about the structure of HackTheBox can be found on the [HTB knowledge base](https://help.hackthebox.com/en/articles/5185158-gs-introduction-to-hack-the-box).
