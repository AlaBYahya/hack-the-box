# Paper Writeup

## Enumeration

### Nmap

First, let's scan for open ports using `nmap`. We can quickly scan for open ports and store them in a variable: `ports=$(nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 10.10.11.143 | grep ^[0-9] | cut -d '/' -f 1 | tr '\n' ',' | sed s/,$//)`. Then, we can scan those specific ports in depth by running `nmap`'s built-in scripts: `nmap -p$ports -sC -sV 10.10.11.143`.

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp  open  ssh      OpenSSH 8.0 (protocol 2.0)

```

We have a an Apache webserver running on ports 80 and 443 in addition to SSH on port 22. Browsing to the website shows "HTTP Server Test Page powered by CentOS".

### Apache

Directory bruteforcing doesn't provide any details: `gobuster dir -u http://10.10.11.143 -t 100 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt`., Couldn't find any vulnerabilties for the Apache/OpenSSL/PHP versions (`x-powered-by header: PHP/7.2.24`) being used.

Running `nikto` with `nikto -h http://10.10.11.143` finds `Uncommon header 'x-backend-server' found, with contents: office.paper`. So, lets add that to the `/etc/hosts` file: `echo "10.10.11.143 office.paper" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`.

### Wordpress

`office.paper` is a wordpress instance. Browsing around we find the page `http://office.paper/index.php/2021/06/19/feeling-alone/` with a comment saying "Michael, you should remove the secret content from your drafts ASAP, as they are not that secure as you think! -Nick," which indicates that there is information in drafted posts for us to find.

Let's run `wpscan`: `wpscan --url http://office.paper`.

Based on the comment we found, it looks like "WordPress <= 5.2.3 - Unauthenticated View Private/Draft Posts" is going to be the exploit we want to use. Navigating to [wpscan.com link](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/3413b879-785f-4c9f-aa8a-5a4a1d5e0ba2), we see a proof of concept, `http://wordpress.local/?static=1&order=asc`. However, this didn't work. Exploring another [linked page that goes into more detail](https://0day.work/proof-of-concept-for-wordpress-5-2-3-viewing-unauthenticated-posts/), we see that just using `http://wordpress.local/?static=1` should work. Navigating to `http://office.paper/?static=1` we see the below post:

```

Micheal please remove the secret from drafts for gods sake!

Hello employees of Blunder Tiffin,

Due to the orders from higher officials, every employee who were added to this blog is removed and they are migrated to our new chat system.

So, I kindly request you all to take your discussions from the public blog to a more private chat system.

-Nick

# Warning for Michael

Michael, you have to stop putting secrets in the drafts. It is a huge security issue and you have to stop doing it. -Nick

# Secret Registration URL of new Employee chat system

http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY

# I am keeping this draft unpublished, as unpublished drafts cannot be accessed by outsiders. I am not that ignorant, Nick.

# Also, stop looking at my drafts. Jeez!
```

We have discoverd a new subdomain. Let's add it to `/etc/hosts`: `echo "10.10.11.143 chat.office.paper" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`.

### Rocket.chat

Navigating to `http://chat.office.paper` reveals a [rocket.chat](https://rocket.chat/) instance. Going to the "Secret Registration URL", `http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY`, shows a registration page. After signing up we see the rocket.chat interface. We can click the globe icon in the top left to see a directory of channels we can join. The general channel has messages about how a bot, "recyclops," was recently added. We can direct message the bot to interaction with it. Running the `recyclops help` command lists the available commands.

## Foothold

Interactions with the `recyclops` bot to find some useful information:

## Lateral Movement

As you can see, running `recyclops file ../hubot/.env` gives us a password of `Queenofblad3s!23`. Using that password to SSH into the box as the user `dwight` (since that name has been mentioned a lot and it is the user whose file we have been browsing) works. We can now `cat user.txt` and get the user flag.

## Privilege Escalation

Connect with [calebstewart/pwncat](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat) with `pwncat-cs dwight@10.10.11.143`. Pwncat's built-in escalation techniques (`escalate list -u root`) do not work. Upload [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) to the box with `upload linpeas.sh`. Then, run LinPEAS with `bash linpeas.sh`

LinPEAS immediately tells us that the installed version of `sudo` is vulnerable to `CVE-2021-3560`.

I initially read `CVE-2021-3560` as `CVE-2021-4034`, which are both polkit local privilege escalation vulnerabilities. `CVE-2021-4034` is a [very recent exploit](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4034) ([disclosed to public on January 25th, 2022](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2022/01/25/pwnkit-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-discovered-in-polkits-pkexec-cve-2021-4034)) and I thought it unlikely to be the intended solution because it is so new. Downloading [berdav/CVE-2021-4034](https://github.com/berdav/CVE-2021-4034) as a ZIP file, copying the file over, unzipping it, running `make` in the directory, and then executing `./cve-2021-4034` doesn't work:

```
GLib: Cannot convert message: Could not open converter from “UTF-8” to “PWNKIT”
pkexec must be setuid root
```

If we run `ls -la /usr/bin/pkexec` we can see that the permissions are `-rwxr-xr-x` not `-rwsr-xr-x`.

The [older polkit local privilege escalation exploit](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-3560), `CVE-2021-3560` ([Official blog post by person who discovered exploit](https://github.blog/2021-06-10-privilege-escalation-polkit-root-on-linux-with-bug/)), is the one that LinPEAS recommended and it does work.

Searching GitHub for this CVE finds several repositories, but after trying several, [secnigma/CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation](https://github.com/secnigma/CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation) seems to work the best at the time of writing. [Download the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secnigma/CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation/main/poc.sh), upload it to the target machine, and then run it like so: `./poc.sh -u=john -p=john`. Then, run `su - john` to switch to the new user and execute `sudo bash` to get a root shell. I was able to get this root shell after running the script for the third time.

Finally, `cat /root/root.txt` to get the root flag.
